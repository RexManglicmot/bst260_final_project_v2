**Answer:** The graph shows population trends over time by age group and sex. 

For both males and females, younger age groups (e.g., 15–19, 20–24) exhibit a gradual decline in population size over time, potentially reflecting declining birth rates. Middle-aged groups (e.g., 35–39, 40–44) show relatively stable trends, while older age groups (e.g., 65–69, 70–74) have increasing population sizes, likely due to aging demographics and improved life expectancy. Females consistently have higher population counts in older age groups compared to males, reflecting longer female life expectancy. Notable shifts in population sizes around certain years may correspond to external factors, such as migration or natural disasters.


Q2. Use data from before 2017 to estimate expected mortality and a standard deviation for each week. Do this by age group and sex. Describe tendencies you observe. You can combine data into bigger age groups if the data show they have similar death rates.

```{r}
# Filter data for dates before 2017
pre_2017_data <- df %>%
  filter(date < as.Date("2017-01-01")) %>%
  mutate(week = isoweek(date), year = year(date))

# Combine age groups into broader categories if needed
pre_2017_data <- pre_2017_data %>%
  mutate(agegroup_combined = case_when(
    agegroup %in% c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14") ~ "0-14",
    agegroup %in% c("15-19", "20-24", "25-29") ~ "15-29",
    TRUE ~ agegroup
  ))

# Calculate weekly expected mortality and standard deviation
weekly_mortality_summary <- pre_2017_data %>%
  group_by(year, week, agegroup_combined, sex) %>%

**Answer:** The analysis of weekly mortality data before 2017 reveals distinct patterns across age groups and sexes. Seniors (65+) exhibit the highest expected mortality rates and the greatest variability, with males consistently showing higher values than females. This reflects the impact of age-related health risks and potential disparities in health outcomes between sexes. Adults (30–64) also show notable variability in mortality, likely due to the diverse health conditions and external factors affecting this age group. In contrast, children (0–14) and young adults (15–29) maintain relatively low expected mortality rates and standard deviations, indicative of lower health risks in these groups. However, occasional spikes in these younger populations may suggest rare events or anomalies, such as infectious disease outbreaks or data irregularities. Overall, the trends align with expected age-related mortality patterns and highlight the importance of focusing on older age groups, particularly seniors, in mortality analysis.

**Answer:** The analysis of pre-2017 data estimates expected mortality and its standard deviation by week, age group, and sex. The age groups were combined into **Children (0-14)**, **Young Adults (15-29)**, **Adults (30-64)**, and **Seniors (65+)** to highlight broader patterns. Among children, both expected mortality and its variability are low and stable across weeks. In young adults, females exhibit slightly higher expected mortality than males, though both sexes show consistent trends with minimal variability. For adults aged 30-64, males consistently have higher expected mortality and greater variability compared to females, especially noticeable in later weeks. Seniors (65+) show the highest expected mortality and the largest variability, with males experiencing greater fluctuations and rates than females.

The results reveal clear patterns: expected mortality and its variability increase with age, and males consistently face higher mortality risk and variability than females across all age groups. Children display the most stable trends, while older populations, particularly seniors, are most affected. These observations align with known demographic trends, where aging populations and males tend to have higher mortality rates. Combining smaller age groups into broader categories simplifies the analysis and emphasizes these tendencies effectively.

First Graph: Weekly Expected Mortality by Age Group and Sex (Pre-2017)
The first graph displays weekly expected mortality trends across detailed age groups and sexes before 2017. In younger age groups (0-14, 15-19, 20-24), expected mortality is very low and stable, with minimal differences between males and females. However, males consistently show slightly higher mortality than females. For adults aged 25-59, mortality progressively increases with age, and a clear sex disparity emerges, with males exhibiting higher mortality rates than females across all sub-groups. In older adults (60-74), mortality rates increase significantly, and the male-female gap widens further, indicating greater vulnerability among older males. Seniors aged 75+ experience the highest mortality levels, although the gap between sexes narrows in the oldest group (85+), where female mortality rates begin to catch up.

Second Graph: Weekly Mortality Standard Deviation by Age Group and Sex (Pre-2017)
The second graph illustrates the variability in weekly mortality rates, as captured by the standard deviation. Younger age groups (0-14, 15-19) exhibit very low variability, indicating stable mortality trends with occasional spikes in the 5-9 and 10-14 subgroups, likely caused by outlier events. Variability begins to increase in the adult age groups (25-59), particularly in the 50-54 and 55-59 age ranges, where males display consistently higher standard deviations than females. For older adults (60-74), the standard deviation rises further, reflecting greater week-to-week mortality fluctuations likely influenced by seasonal or external factors. Seniors aged 75+ experience the highest variability, particularly for males, as mortality rates become less predictable with increasing age.

Combining Age Groups Based on Observed Trends
Based on the observed trends in both expected mortality and its variability, it is reasonable to combine age groups that exhibit similar mortality patterns. The 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 age groups can be combined into a single "0-14" category due to their low and stable mortality. Similarly, the 15-19, 20-24, and 25-29 age groups can be combined into a "15-29" category, given their comparable mortality levels and minimal variability. Adults aged 30-59 (30-34 to 55-59) can be grouped together, as they show a gradual increase in mortality with age but maintain consistent trends. The 60-64, 65-69, and 70-74 age groups can be combined into a "60-74" category, given their similar mortality levels and variability. However, the seniors (75-79, 80-84, and 85+) should remain separate, as they display distinct mortality increases and greater variability, particularly among males.


```{r}
# Combine age groups based on similar mortality trends
pre_2017_data <- pre_2017_data %>%

The first graph, **"Weekly Expected Mortality by Combined Age Groups and Sex (Pre-2017)"**, displays the expected mortality trends across broader combined age groups. The results highlight clear patterns: older age groups, particularly **60–74, 75–79, 80–84, and 85+**, consistently show higher mortality rates compared to younger groups, with males exhibiting higher values than females across all age categories. Notably, the mortality trends for males in the oldest groups (85-Inf and 75–79) remain elevated and more variable, whereas females show a relatively smoother trend. In younger age groups such as **0–14** and **15–29**, mortality rates are substantially lower and display less variability, with sex differences being minimal. **Adults (30–59)** exhibit moderate mortality rates, where males maintain a consistent upward trend compared to females, reflecting a clear and persistent sex disparity.

The second graph, **"Weekly Mortality Standard Deviation by Combined Age Groups and Sex (Pre-2017)"**, highlights the variability in mortality rates. Similar to the first graph, older age groups like **80–84, 85+**, and **75–79** demonstrate the highest standard deviations, particularly for males, indicating greater fluctuations in weekly mortality rates. The **60–74** group also shows notable variability, though less pronounced than the oldest groups. In contrast, younger age groups such as **0–14** and **15–29** exhibit lower standard deviations, reflecting more stable and consistent mortality trends with minimal sex-based differences. The **30–59** group, while having moderate variability, again reveals higher standard deviations for males compared to females. These findings underscore that mortality variability increases with age and is more pronounced among males, particularly in older age groups.

**Answer:** The data exploration identified several weeks before 2017 with periods of excess mortality, primarily affecting Seniors (65+). These weeks were systematically flagged as having mortality rates exceeding the baseline by more than 2 standard deviations. After removing these excess periods, the recomputed expected mortality rates were more stable and reflected typical trends for each age group and sex. The adjusted mortality data confirmed that mortality risk increases with age, with Seniors and Adults being the most impacted groups. Males consistently exhibited higher mortality than females across all age groups. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and adjusting for excess mortality to provide a clearer baseline for further analysis.

This graph highlights periods of **excess mortality** (in cyan) across combined age groups and sexes before 2017. Excess mortality is determined as weeks where observed mortality exceeds the mean mortality by more than **2 standard deviations** for each group. **Seniors (65+)** show the most frequent and extreme excess mortality, particularly for both males and females, suggesting that older adults are disproportionately affected, with notable concentrations toward the end of the year, possibly due to seasonal factors such as winter illnesses. **Adults (30–64)** experience moderate excess mortality in both sexes, occurring sporadically throughout the year, though less frequently compared to seniors, with occasional spikes in mid-year weeks. In contrast, **Young Adults (15–29)** and **Children (0–14)** exhibit lower observed mortality overall, with fewer weeks showing excess mortality, and these occurrences are relatively isolated across the year. **Sex differences** reveal that males generally display a slightly higher frequency of excess mortality compared to females across all age groups, particularly in the **Adults (30–64)** and **Seniors (65+)** categories, though the trend varies within specific groups.


To address the second part of the question and recompute expected mortality excluding these periods, I identified weeks with excess mortality by filtering data points where observed mortality exceeded the mean plus two standard deviations. These weeks were excluded from the computation of expected mortality to produce a cleaner baseline. The recomputed graph shows expected mortality trends without excess mortality weeks. The second graph reveals smoother expected mortality trends, with noticeable reductions in variability.

# Step 1: Remove weeks with excess mortality

**Answer:** By removing weeks with excess mortality, the recomputed expected mortality rates present smoother and more stable trends across combined age groups and sexes. Among Seniors (65+), expected mortality is the highest, with males consistently exhibiting higher rates than females. A slight upward trend is observed in the later weeks for both sexes. For Adults (30-64), mortality rates remain relatively stable over time, but males continue to show noticeably higher expected mortality compared to females. Young Adults (15-29) display much lower expected mortality rates than older groups, yet males still exhibit slightly higher values than females. Finally, Children (0-14) have the lowest expected mortality, characterized by minimal fluctuations, though male rates remain marginally higher. Overall, removing weeks with excess mortality smooths out extreme values, revealing clearer, persistent sex disparities—particularly in older age groups—and emphasizing consistent mortality patterns across weeks.

**Answer:** By removing weeks with excess mortality, the recomputed expected mortality rates will be less influenced by extreme values. This provides a more accurate baseline for comparison and analysis.The recomputed expected mortality graph, excluding periods of excess mortality before 2017, reveals smoother and more stable trends across combined age groups and sex. Among **seniors (65+)**, expected mortality is highest, with males consistently showing higher rates than females and a slight upward trend in later weeks. **Adults (30-64)** exhibit relatively stable mortality rates, with a clear disparity where males have higher expected mortality than females. For **young adults (15-29)**, both sexes show lower expected mortality compared to older age groups, though males still maintain slightly higher rates. **Children (0-14)** have the lowest expected mortality, with minimal fluctuations, and males again exhibit slightly higher rates than females. Overall, removing weeks with excess mortality has smoothed the data, highlighting persistent sex differences in expected mortality, particularly among older age groups, and revealing more consistent patterns across the weeks.

**Answer:** During 2017–2018, significant excess deaths were observed across various weeks, with a notable spike during the week of Hurricane María's landfall (September 20, 2017). This spike is most prominent among seniors (65+), highlighting their heightened vulnerability during and after the disaster. Adults aged 30–64 also experienced elevated excess deaths, although to a lesser extent. Young adults (15–29) and children (0–14) were minimally affected, with little to no substantial excess mortality recorded during the period.

Gender differences were evident across all age groups. For most weeks, males experienced slightly higher excess deaths than females, particularly among adults aged 30–64 and young adults. However, among seniors, females demonstrated higher excess deaths, possibly due to their higher baseline population and increased susceptibility to the indirect effects of the disaster. These findings emphasize the disproportionate impact of Hurricane María on older age groups and the potential gendered differences in disaster-related mortality.

**Answer:** The graph provides a comprehensive visualization of mortality trends during 2017–2018, with a distinct spike in mortality observed around **Week 38**, corresponding to the week Hurricane María made landfall. This sharp increase indicates **excess mortality**, particularly affecting **Seniors (65+)** and **Adults (30-64)**. Among Seniors, mortality rates rise significantly for both sexes, but males consistently experience higher observed mortality compared to females, suggesting that older men were disproportionately impacted. A similar pattern emerges among Adults, where mortality spikes more dramatically for males than females, emphasizing a clear **sex-based disparity** and highlighting the heightened vulnerability of older males during catastrophic events.

In **younger age groups**, including **Young Adults (15-29)** and **Children (0-14)**, mortality trends exhibit relatively smaller increases, with more variability over time. For Children, the mortality spike is modest, and sex differences are less apparent, indicating a smaller overall impact on this group. Young Adults show slightly elevated mortality rates, but as observed in older age groups, males consistently experience higher mortality than females. The **sex disparity** becomes more pronounced with increasing age, suggesting that older males were the most vulnerable demographic during this period.

By incorporating Corri's advice to analyze both age and sex differences, the visualization and analysis highlight which groups were most affected and how men and women were impacted differently. The findings reveal that **Seniors and Adults** were the hardest-hit groups, with mortality surging for both sexes but at a greater magnitude for males. In contrast, younger age groups experienced less severe increases in mortality. These observations align with broader trends in mortality outcomes during catastrophic events, where older males often face disproportionate risks. The analysis effectively underscores the combined influence of **age** and **sex** on mortality outcomes, providing a clear and insightful response to the question.
